[Link to presentation](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFePEY-MiE/9FkOthYpShu-g_ya5c_inA/view)

## Project Overview
This project involves the development of a smart irrigation system that leverages the Internet of Things (IoT) to automate and optimize water management for agricultural purposes. The system utilizes various sensors to collect data, which is then analyzed to determine the optimal irrigation schedule.

## Key Features
- **Automated Irrigation**: Uses soil moisture and temperature sensors to automatically trigger irrigation, ensuring optimal water usage.
- **Data Collection and Analysis**: Collects data from sensors and displays it on a ThingSpeak dashboard for real-time monitoring and analysis.
- **IoT Integration**: Incorporates ESP32 microcontroller to connect sensors and actuators to the cloud for remote management.
- **Modular Design**: Designed with modular components including solenoid valves, flow sensors, and a capacitive soil moisture sensor for enhanced reliability and longevity.

## Implementation Details
The system is implemented using various hardware components:
- **ESP32 Microcontroller**: Handles data collection from sensors and communication with the ThingSpeak cloud platform.
- **DHT22 Sensor**: Measures temperature and humidity.
- **Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor**: Provides accurate soil moisture readings without corrosion issues.
- **Solenoid Valve**: Controls water flow based on sensor data.
- **Flow Sensor**: Monitors the amount of water dispensed.

The collected data is processed and analyzed to make real-time irrigation decisions, ensuring water is used efficiently and plant health is maintained.
